# Instrument Collector - Project Roadmap

## 🚀 Current Status: Showroom V2 (Completed)
- **Features**: Custom Cover Images, Granular Privacy/Visibility (Draft, Private, Public, Unlisted), Kiosk Mode Toggle.
- **Tech**: Next.js 14 Server Actions, MongoDB Mongoose, TypeScript.

---

## 📅 Short-Term: Showroom V3 - Phase 1 (The Slide Engine)
*Goal: Transform static single-image items into dynamic multi-slide exhibits.*

### 1. Data Model Evolution
- [ ] **Update `IShowroomItem`**: Add `slides: ISlide[]` array.
    ```typescript
    interface ISlide {
        id: string;
        type: 'image' | 'text' | 'specs_grid';
        content: string; // URL or Text
        caption?: string;
    }
    ```
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: Use existing `collectionId.images[0]` as fallback if `slides` is empty.

### 2. Editor & UX
- [ ] **Slide Editor**: UI to add/remove/order slides for a specific instrument in the showroom.
- [ ] **"Magic Import 1.0"**: When adding an instrument, optionally auto-generate:
    - Slide 1: Main Photo.
    - Slide 2: Placard Text (if exists).

### 3. Public View
- [ ] **Carousel/Slider**: Replace static image card with a mini-carousel in the grid (or just on hover?).
- [ ] **QR Code Generation**: Generate a unique QR code for each showroom to allow physical kiosks/visitors to scan and jump directly to the digital version.
- [ ] **Kiosk Upgrade**: Clicking "Modo Kiosko" cycles through ALL slides of ALL instruments automatically.

---

## 🔭 Mid-Term: Showroom V3 - Phase 2 (Digital Museum)
*Goal: Structure and Storytelling.*

### 1. Hierarchy
- [ ] **Rooms/Sections**: `Showroom -> Room (e.g., "The 70s") -> Items`.
- [ ] **Curatorial Cards**: Items that are *not* instruments, but text/posters describing the section.

### 2. Advanced Editor
- [ ] **Drag & Drop**: Reorder items and slides visually.
- [ ] **Layouts**: Choose slide layouts (Hero, Split, Grid).

- [x] **API Integration**: Discogs and Spotify for album import.
- [x] **Smart Caching**: Reuse albums across users to reduce API calls.
- [ ] **Master Release Architecture**: Implement "Supra-Albums" (similar to Discogs Master Release) to group multiple editions/versions.
  - [x] **Data Inheritance**: Musical context (instruments) added to a Master Release automatically propagates to all its versions.
  - [x] **UI Unification**: Display global instrument associations even when viewing a specific local edition (Vinyl vs CD).

### 2. Musical Relationships System ✅ COMPLETED
*Goal: Cross-linking instruments, artists, and albums with bidirectional synchronization.*

#### Phase 1: Artist/Band Management ✅

- [x] **Admin Panel**: CRUD for Artists in `MetadataManager` with Discogs refresh.
- [x] **Metadata Navigation**: Integrated into Navbar ("Museo") and Dashboard.

- [x] **Metadata Multi-Image Support**: Support multiple images/logos for ALL metadata types (Brands, Artists, Types, Decades).
  - [x] **Primary Selector**: Admin/Editor UI to select the "Active" or "Primary" image/logo.
  - [x] **Batch Import**: Pull all available images from Discogs/External APIs.

  - [ ] **Stats Dashboard**: Visualize distribution and density of the collection.
  - [ ] **Dynamic Counts**: Show counts in filters and administrative lists.
        4. **"Silent" Deep Enrichment**: Automatically fetch and persist missing specs when a user views an instrument (Lazy Enrichment).
        5. **Specs Pro UX Refinement**: 
            - Relocate the manual enrichment trigger from "Market" to "Specifications" to better align with user mental models.
            - Enhance `MagicImporter` with clear labeling and structured guidance for "Specs Pro" mode, distinguishing it from general AI analysis.
        6. **Automated Sync (Cron Jobs)**:
#### Phase 2: N-M Relationships & Bidirectional Sync ✅
- [x] **Bidirectional Logic**: Automatic reverse links (`CatalogMetadata.instruments`, `MusicAlbum.instruments`).
- [x] **Sync Utilities**: `bidirectional.ts` service for background relationship maintenance.
- [x] **Artist-Album Link**: Auto-linking albums to their artist metadata.

#### Phase 3: UI for Associations & AI Discovery ✅
- [x] **Instrument Detail Page**: Added "Used by Artists/Albums" section with management UI.

- [x] **Bug Investigation**: Review "Musical Context" selector.
  - **Issue**: Some existing artists in the catalog are not appearing in the search results.
  - **Resolution**: Code logic is correct. Missing artists were due to missing database entries or incorrect `type`.

#### Phase 3: Catalog Encyclopedia & Discovery ✅
- [x] **Rich Metadata Profiles**: Dynamic landing pages for Artists, Brands, Decades, and Types.
- [x] **Discovery Engine**: Statistics, averages, and usage grids per category.

## 💡 Strategic Backlog & Feature Sandbox (To Review)
*Concepts for future evaluation and design.*

### 1. The "Curator" Experience (Showroom Evolution)
*   **Concept**: Shift from "Inventory/Warehouse" to "Gallery/Art".
*   **Micro-Stories (The Slide Engine V2)**:
    *   Treat each item as a "Container of Scenes":
        *   *Scene 1*: General Photo + Intro Voiceover.
        *   *Scene 2*: Technical Detail (Pickups/Labels) + Text.
        *   *Scene 3*: Context (Photo of the album where it was used).
*   **Audio Guides & Voiceovers**:
    *   Integrated recorder (browser-based) or file upload to user's storage (Cloudinary/Drive).
    *   **Timeline Sync**: User defines duration per slide (e.g., "Intro lasts 10s").
*   **Dynamic Layouts**: Templates for "Grid", "Timeline", or "Museum Wall" styles.
*   **Connected Items**: "See Related" button inside a slide (e.g., jump from Instrument to Album).

### 2. Social & Collaboration (Exposiciones Compartidas & Préstamos)
*   **Virtual Loans**:
    *   **Request Flow**: Define "Missing Pieces" (e.g., "Need a '62 Precision Bass") -> Search available items -> Request Loan.
    *   **Attribution**: "Lent by [User]" label and dynamic watermarking for borrowed items.
    *   **Catalog Placeholders**: Use "Master Catalog Records" as educational references if the item is missing.
*   **Shared Showrooms**: "Curator in Chief" invites collaborators.
*   **Duplicate/Fork Showroom**: Allow users to duplicate their own showrooms or "Fork" public showrooms.
*   **Internal Tools**: "Assembly Chat" for curation discussions.

### 3. Gamification & Community 🚧 IN PROGRESS
*   **Thematic Contests** (`Exhibition` models):
    *   [x] **Models**: `Exhibition`, `ExhibitionSubmission`, `ExhibitionVote`.
    *   [ ] **UI**: Contest listing and submission flow.
*   **Badges System** (`Badge` models):
    *   [x] **Infrastructure**: `Badge`, `UserBadge` models and `BadgeManager` UI.
    *   [x] **Seed Script**: `seedBadges.ts`.
    *   [ ] **Triggers**: Auto-award badges based on activity.
*   **Blog/Content**:
    *   [x] **Models**: `Article`, `FeaturedContent`, `Comment`.
    *   [ ] **Public Blog**: View for curated content.

### 4. Technical & UX Refinements
*   **Autoplay Mode (TV Style)**: "Play All" button that cycles through slides and audio automatically.
*   **Performance**: Aggressive pre-fetching of next slides/audio.
*   **Accessibility**: Auto-transcripts for audio guides.
*   **Image Protection**: Watermarking for High-Res assets.

### 5. Proposed Data Architecture (V3 Advanced)
*   `Showroom_Items`: Add `RelationshipType` (Owned / Loaned / Reference).
*   `Loans` Collection: `RequesterID`, `OwnerID`, `ItemID`, `Status` (Pending/Accepted).
*   `Slides`: `AudioURL`, `DurationSeconds`, `CrossLinkID`.

    - **Media Mixing**: Overlay voiceovers (locuciones) and background music/SFX on slides.
    - **Image Library**: Select images from existing collection/gallery instead of forced re-upload.
*   **Multimedia**: Audio samples (instrument sounds, album tracks) and Video reviews/clips.
*   **Publication Scheduling**: Set Start/End dates for exhibition visibility (Immediate/Indefinite by default).
*   **Catalog Integration**: Direct deep-links from an exhibit to the official technical catalog entry.
*   **WebAR**: "Place this instrument in your room" using mobile camera.
*   **"Near Me" Map**: Geolocation for local collector meetups/exhibitions.

### 5. Events & Live
